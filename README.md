Update:Changed the tray icons to prefered ones.

A Windows tray app that monitors WinINet proxy settings for LAN (not VPN) and enables quick proxy on/off switch.

- A mouse hover-over tip shows proxy server info when proxy is on or "Direct" when off.
- Left click on the tray icon toggles proxy on/off status. Proxy server info must be pre-configured externally. If no configuration is found, automatically opens Windows proxy setting panel.
- Right-click opens context menu.
    - "Proxy Setting" opens Windows network proxy setting panel.
    - "Quit" exits the tray app.

Targets .NET Framework 4.8 that is included in Windows 11.
